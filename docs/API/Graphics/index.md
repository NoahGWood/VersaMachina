# Graphics API

Graphics in VersaMachina use a number of backends depending on the targeted platform.


- [Window](Window/index.md)

- [2D Graphics](2D/index.md)
- [3D Graphics](2D/index.md)

## Platform Specific API's

The following API's are used to develop the platform-specific backend for VersaMachina's Graphics API. If you want to add GUI support for new platforms, you will need to implement the following API's for your new backend:

- [Renderer](Renderer/index.md)
- [Swap Chain](Renderer/index.md)
- [Frame Buffer](Renderer/index.md)
- [Vertex Buffer](Renderer/index.md)
- [Index Buffer](Renderer/index.md)
- [Shader](Renderer/index.md)
- [States](Renderer/index.md)
- [Pipelines](Renderer/index.md)
- [Render Passes](Renderer/index.md)
